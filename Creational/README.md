> Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of related objects.

- **Context:** Deal with object creation mechanisms.
>When creating an object is not just a few assignments and involves some logic, it makes sense to put it in a dedicated factory instead of repeating the same code everywhere.

- **Problem:** Try to create system with less complexity to the design.

- **Solution:** Controlling this object creation.

####These are Creational Patterns:
