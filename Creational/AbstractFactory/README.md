*****Sets of methods to make various objects.*****
>Creates an instance of several families of classes.
>A factory of factories; a factory that groups the individual but related/dependent factories together without specifying their concrete classes.


>The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes


- **Context:** When there are interrelated dependencies with not-that-simple creation logic involved

- **Problem:** What are we trying to solve?

- **Solution:** How does using this pattern solve our proposed problem?
Implementation: What does the implementation look like?  

**Example1:**  Based on your needs you might get a wooden door from a wooden door shop, iron door from an iron shop or a PVC door from the relevant shop. Plus you might need a guy with different kind of specialities to fit the door, for example a carpenter for wooden door, welder for iron door etc. As you can see there is a dependency between the doors now, wooden door needs carpenter, iron door needs a welder etc
