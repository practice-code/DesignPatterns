>Simple factory simply generates an instance for client without exposing any instantiation logic to the client


> Simple factory is an object for creating other objects â€“ formally a factory is a function or method that returns objects of a varying prototype or class from some method call, which is assumed to be "new".

- **Context:** When creating an object is not just a few assignments and involves some logic, it makes sense to put it in a dedicated factory instead of repeating the same code everywhere.

- **Problem:** What are we trying to solve?

- **Solution:** How does using this pattern solve our proposed problem?
Implementation: What does the implementation look like?  


**Example1:**  you are building a house and you need doors. It would be a mess if every time you need a door, you put on your carpenter clothes and start making a door in your house. Instead you get it made from a factory.
